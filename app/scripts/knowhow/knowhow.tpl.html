            <h4>Alternating Current vs Direct Current</h4>
            <dl>
                <dt>Alternating Current</dt>
                <dd>Alternating Current (AC) is changing the voltage from positive to negative several times per second,
                    and is used
                    in our power grid. AC is what a power turbines produce.
                    The voltage can be transformed to any desired value. Higher voltage allows
                    for thinner cables, but requires more insulation.

                <dd>Direct Current (DC) has a constant voltage. This is produced e.g. by Photovoltaics, or by converting
                    AC to DC. It can be used to charge batteries. Converting DC to AC can also be done by using an
                    Inverter.

            <h4>Charging Station</h4>

            <p>A charging station provides one or several options to charge electric cars. </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>"Dumb" Power outlet ("Mode 1 and 2")</dt>
                <dd>The simplest variant of a charging station just provides a power outlet with grid power. If the
                    connection to the car is made with a simple cable, it is "Mode 1" charging (none of the currently
                    available cars allows for this anymore).
                    All currently available cars support "Mode 2", which means a wall connector (see further below) is requred to connect to the onbord charger, and
                    the onboard charger has to convert the alternating current into direct current to make it
                    useable for charging the battery.

                <dt>Car Charging Outlet ("Mode 3")</dt>
                <dd>A car charging outlet already contains the electronics to communicate
                    with the car and only switches on power once the car confirms the cable is safely connected. But the
                    power which flows to the car is the exact same AC current which is on the grid just like it would be
                    a "dumb" power outlet. It has to be converted into direct current by the onboard charger.

                <dt>Quick Charging Station</dt>
                <dd>The so called quick charger stations contain charging devices which already convert the AC from the
                    grid to DC which will be applied directly to the battery. The onboard charger of the car is
                    bypassed. However, this requires the charging station to be compatible with the car obviously.

            <h4>Wall Connector</h4>

            <p>The wall connector is used to connect the car to a wall outlet. It is required because electric cars use
                a handshake protocol to confirm a safe connection before any electric power is applied to the cable.</p>

            <h4>Charger</h4>

            <p>The charger is a device with a rectifier and some electronics. It converts alternating current into
                direct current, but has some logic to make sure the battery is charged according to the specs. Most cars
                have an on-board charger. However, there are also some charging
                stations which have built-in chargers to provide higher power and quicker charging.</p>

            <h4>(Traction-) Battery</h4>

            <p>The battery, which consists of several hundreds or thousands of cells, is used to store electric energy.
                Lithium Ion cells usually have a voltage of 3.7 Volts.
                Combining the cells into packs with some serial circuits brings the voltage of the traction battery to
                approximately
                400V. It is called <i>traction</i> battery because it is used to generate forward traction of the car.
            </p>

            <h4>Inverter</h4>

            <p>The inverter does the opposite of the Rectifier: it converts DC to AC and can be used if an AC motor
                should
                be powered by a battery. Or if power from Photovoltaics should be fed into the grid.</p>

            <h4>Motor</h4>

            <p>The motor converts electric energy into kinetic energy (in the case of cars, it first becomes a rotating
                motion
                of the shafts and gears, but since they turn the wheels which apply the rotating energy to the street,
                in the
                end it becomes a linear motion of the car). This conversion obviously can't be 100% efficient either
                since some energy is "lost" in the form of heat.</p>

                <dd>Not a scientific term. If a battery is "bricked", it means it is dead due to very low discharge and
                    therefore doesn't any help more than a brick.
                    A low discharge may severely damage the battery, which is why most manufacturers use some
                    software logic to prevent such a discharge.

                <dt>C</dt>
                <dd><b>Coulumb</b> is an SI unit to measure charge. Charging a 22kWh battery with 22kW is 1C. Charging
                    it with 44kW is 2C. With current battery technology, 2C is just about the maximum recommended
                    factor. Anything above it will shorten the battery life.

                <dt>Charging loss</dt>
                <dd>This term may be a bit confusing since according to physics, energy can not actually be lost. It can
                    only be transformed. But the
                    purpose of a charger in combination with a battery is to convert electric energy to chemical energy.
                    And this purpose is only met usually to about 90%. The rest of the electric energy is transformed
                    into thermal energy (aka heat). Depending on the charger, it may even be required to cool the
                    devices, which consumes power as well.
