                <dt>Alternating Current</dt>
                <dd>Alternating Current (AC) is changing the voltage from positive to negative several times per second,
                    and is used
                    in our power grid. AC is what power turbines produce.
                    The voltage can be transformed to any desired value. Higher voltage allows
                    for thinner cables, but requires more insulation.

                    Inverter.

            <h4>Charging Station</h4>

            <p>A charging station provides one or several options to charge electric cars. </p>
            <dl ng-class="{'selected-term':term === 'infrastructure'}">
                <dt>"Dumb" Power outlet ("Mode 1 and 2")</dt>
                <dd>The simplest variant of a charging station just provides a power outlet with grid power. If the
                    connection to the car is made with a simple cable, it is "Mode 1" charging (none of the currently
                    available cars allows for this anymore).
                    All currently available cars support "Mode 2", which means a wall connector (see further below) is
                    requred to connect to the onbord charger, and
                    the onboard charger has to convert the alternating current into direct current to make it
                    useable for charging the battery.

                <dt>Car Charging Outlet ("Mode 3")</dt>
                <dd>A car charging outlet already contains the electronics to communicate
                    with the car and only switches on power once the car confirms the cable is safely connected. But the
                    power which flows to the car is the exact same AC current which is on the grid just like it would be
                    a "dumb" power outlet. It has to be converted into direct current by the onboard charger.

                    grid to DC which will be applied directly to the battery. The onboard charger of the car is
                    bypassed. However, this requires the charging station to be compatible with the car obviously.

            <h4>Wall Connector</h4>

            <p>The wall connector is used to connect the car to a wall outlet. It is required because electric cars use
                a handshake protocol to confirm a safe connection before any electric power is applied to the cable.</p>

            <h4>Charger</h4>

            <p>The charger is a device with a rectifier and some electronics. It converts alternating current into
                direct current, but has some logic to make sure the battery is charged according to the specs. Most cars
                have an on-board charger. However, there are also some charging
                stations which have built-in chargers to provide higher power and quicker charging.</p>

            <h4>(Traction-) Battery</h4>

            <p>The battery, which consists of several hundreds or thousands of cells, is used to store electric energy.
                Lithium Ion cells usually have a voltage of 3.7 Volts.
                Combining the cells into packs with some serial circuits brings the voltage of the traction battery to
                approximately
                400V. It is called <i>traction</i> battery because it is used to generate forward traction of the car.
            </p>

            <h4>Inverter</h4>

            <p>The inverter does the opposite of the Rectifier: it converts DC to AC and can be used if an AC motor
                should
                be powered by a battery. Or if power from Photovoltaics should be fed into the grid.</p>

            <h4>Motor</h4>

            <p>The motor converts electric energy into kinetic energy (in the case of cars, it first becomes a rotating
                motion
                of the shafts and gears, but since they turn the wheels which apply the rotating energy to the street,
                in the
                end it becomes a linear motion of the car). This conversion obviously can't be 100% efficient either
                since some energy is "lost" in the form of heat.</p>

            <h4>Range</h4>

            <p>The range of any vehicle is depending on a number of factors. For accurate calculation results,
                Electricar.guru will
                take the following parameters into account:
            <dl>
                <dt>Speed</dt>
                <dd ng-class="{'selected-term':term === 'speed'}">
                    Speed has a very big impact on energy consumption, especially with speeds above 60km/h. The air drag
                    increases exponentially with higher speeds, which is why sustaining e.g. 200km/h requires an
                    incredible amount of
                    energy. This can easily be confirmed by measuring the amount of fuel a normal gasoline car uses at
                    that speed.
                    <a name="speed"></a>
                </dd>
                <dt>Driving Style</dt>
                <dd ng-class="{'selected-term':term === 'drivingStyle'}">Just like gasoline cars, also electric cars use
                    more energy when driving more agressive.
                    Also, every acceleration/deceleration cycles uses more energy than just driving with the respective
                    average speed. Since electric
                    cars can feed energy back to the battery, stop-and-go traffic doesn't have such a big impact on
                    range like in
                    gasoline cars, but recuperation is only about 75% efficient. That's 75% better than a gasoline car,
                    but still the overall energy consumption is higher than in normal fluent driving.

                <dt>Terrain</dt>
                <dd ng-class="{'selected-term':term === 'terrain'}">
                    The terrain is an important factor for the range of any vehicle because overcoming the earths
                    gravity takes energy as well. There is a rule of thumb vor electric cars: 1km climbing takes about
                    the same amount as if the car would drive for 40km extra on flat terrain.

                <dd>
                    The aerodynamics of a car is especially important for driving speeds above 60 km/h since the air
                    drag increases exponentially with higher speeds.
                </dd>
                <dt>Vehicle weight</dt>
                <dd>
                    Heavier cars have a higher rolling drag coefficient, which is why heavier cars use more energy for
                    cruising. Also, accelerating requires more power to overcome the inertia. Thanks to recuperation,
                    while decelerating, it is possible to capture up to 75% of that energy and store it back in the
                    battery, and this is even a better value than light cars have (probably around 70%).
                    But still, those missing 25% will be a higher absolute number than the missing 30% of light
                    vehicles.
                </dd>
                <dt>Weather</dt>
                <dd ng-class="{'selected-term':term === 'temperature'}">Both heating and cooling the cabin draws energy
                    from the battery. The bigger the delta between
                    outside
                    and desired cabin temperature (21° Celsius is assumed), the more energy will be needed to adjust the
                    temperature.
                    This is why in cold winter temperatures, it is recommended to pre-heat the cabin while the car is
                    still plugged into a power outlet.
                    Modern electric cars use shore power instead of power from the battery if it is plugged in.
